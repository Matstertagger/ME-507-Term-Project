The goal here is to write a c++ class encapsulating all of the functionality that will be useful for interacting with the motor and to write test code evaluating the functionality of the motor driver class. The motor driver class is able to control the speed of the motors by setting the duty cycle.\hypertarget{page_code_sec_Sen}{}\doxysection{Sensor Operation}\label{page_code_sec_Sen}
Used an ultrasonic sensor to detect a wall that is further away and an infrared sensor to detect when the wall is too close. The Ultrasonic sensor determines when to slow the motors down and the infrared determines when to stop the motors.\hypertarget{page_code_sec_Cal}{}\doxysection{Sensor Calibration}\label{page_code_sec_Cal}
How did we calibrate the sensors. Show plots
